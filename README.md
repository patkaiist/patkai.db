# Patkai.db

Patkai.db is a linguistic database for the Patkai Range which serves as the northern border between India and Myanmar. Data are provided for a large number of Patkaian doculects based on published sources and previously unpublished word lists.

It is based on the [Sal Area Lexical Inventory for Sino-Tibetan](https://github.com/patkaiist/salist) (SALIST, "sal-list") concept list. The database developed from an earlier Tangsa-Nocte (North Patkaian) database, the development of which began in 2018 through support from the La Trobe University department of Languages & Linguistics.
